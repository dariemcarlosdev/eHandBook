This layer contains the entry point to the application.
It includes controllers, or Minimal APIs to create APIs for handling HTTP requests and delivering responses.

FYI:
ASP.NET Core supports two approaches to creating APIs: a controller-based approach and minimal APIs. 
Controllers in an API project are classes that derive from ControllerBase. Minimal APIs define endpoints with logical handlers in lambdas or methods. 

The design of minimal APIs hides the host class by default and focuses on configuration and extensibility via extension methods that take functions as lambda expressions.
Minimal APIs are architected to create HTTP APIs with minimal dependencies. They are ideal for microservices and apps that want to include only the minimum files, features, and dependencies in ASP.NET Core.


Controllers are classes that can take dependencies via constructor injection or property injection, and generally follow object-oriented patterns.
Minimal APIs support dependency injection through other approaches such as accessing the service provider.

It's responsible for mapping HTTP requests to application service methods.
