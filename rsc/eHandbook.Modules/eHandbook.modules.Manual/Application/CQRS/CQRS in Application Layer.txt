In this context, the application layer handles the orchestration of commands and queries without strictly separating them into dedicated layers.

Here's an example how we might structure the CQRS pattern within the application layer of our modular monolithic app:

* Application Layer Structure:

Commands and Queries:
. Define commands and queries specific to each module or feature within the application layer.
. Commands represent actions that change the state of the system, while queries retrieve data without altering the state.

Command Handlers and Query Handlers:
. Implement handlers to process commands and queries within the application layer.
. Handlers encapsulate the business logic to execute the commands or process the queries.

Mediator/Dispatcher:
. Utilize a mediator or dispatcher pattern to dispatch commands and queries to their respective handlers.
. This could be a service or a dedicated class responsible for routing commands and queries to the appropriate handlers.

Example Structure:

- Modules
    - ProductModule
    - OrderModule
    - OtherModules...
- ApplicationLayer
    - Commands
        - CreateProductCommand.cs
        - UpdateProductCommand.cs
        - CreateOrderCommand.cs
        - UpdateOrderCommand.cs
    - Queries
        - GetProductQuery.cs
        - ListProductsQuery.cs
        - GetOrderQuery.cs
        - ListOrdersQuery.cs
    - Handlers
        - CreateProductCommandHandler.cs
        - UpdateProductCommandHandler.cs
        - CreateOrderCommandHandler.cs
        - UpdateOrderCommandHandler.cs
        - GetProductQueryHandler.cs
        - ListProductsQueryHandler.cs
        - GetOrderQueryHandler.cs
        - ListOrdersQueryHandler.cs
    - Dispatcher.cs (or Mediator)

* Workflow:

Command/Query Reception:

Controllers or services within modules send commands or queries to the application layer.

Dispatcher/Mediator Handling:

The dispatcher or mediator in the application layer routes commands to the respective command handlers and queries to the query handlers.

Handler Execution:

Command handlers perform actions like creating/updating data.
Query handlers retrieve data without modifying the state.

* Benefits:

Simplification of Layers: In a modular monolith, this approach simplifies the organization by consolidating CQRS-related logic within the application layer.
Flexibility: It allows for efficient management of commands and queries specific to each module while keeping them within the application's boundaries.

Considerations:

Ensure proper organization of commands, queries, and handlers within the application layer to maintain code readability and manageability.
Implement proper error handling and validation logic within the handlers to ensure the robustness of command execution and query processing.
This approach provides the benefits of CQRS while accommodating the modular structure of your monolithic application.

In simple terms, CQRS helps us to:

Enforce single-responsibility principle (SRP) which states that every module, class or function in a computer program should have responsibility over a single part of that program’s functionality.
Manage frequent changes to your application.
Manage read heavy applications by introducing two databases, one for read and one for write.
