IPipelineBehavior is part of the MediatR library and is used to build a pipeline for handling requests and responses within our application. 
This is an “inner” pipeline that is typically used once a request has already been routed to a specific controller or endpoint(in case of using MinimalApis).

So, in the overall flow of a request through your application:

Middleware components are executed in the order they are added to the pipeline. This includes any global exception handling, logging, or other cross-cutting concerns that are implemented as middleware.
Once the request is routed to a controller action or endpoint, if you’re using MediatR, the IPipelineBehavior components are then executed in the order they are configured.
Therefore, Middleware is executed first, and then the IPipelineBehavior is executed after the request has been routed to a controller action or endpoint.
