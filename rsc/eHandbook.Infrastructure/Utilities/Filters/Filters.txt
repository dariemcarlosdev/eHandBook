Minimal API filters allow developers to implement business logic that supports:

Running code before and after the endpoint handler.
Inspecting and modifying parameters provided during an endpoint handler invocation.
Intercepting the response behavior of an endpoint handler.
Filters can be helpful in the following scenarios:

Validating the request parameters and body that are sent to an endpoint.
Logging information about the request and response.
Validating that a request is targeting a supported API version.
