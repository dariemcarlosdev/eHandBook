This is my project structure for a .NET Core application that combines Vertical Slice Architecture, Modular Monolithic, and Clean Architecture principles.

By following this structure, we can achieve the following benefits:

Modularity: Each module is self-contained and can be developed, tested, and deployed independently.
2.	Modular Monolithic Approach:
•	A modular monolithic approach involves breaking down the monolith into smaller, manageable modules while still keeping them within a single application. This allows you to scale and maintain the application more easily than a traditional monolith.
•	Each module can encapsulate a specific area of functionality, and you can use .NET Core's modularization features like class libraries or modules to achieve this.
•	In a .NET Core application, you can create separate class library projects for each module and then reference these libraries in your main application.


Vertical Slice Architecture: Each module follows a vertical slice pattern, keeping related code together.
1.	Vertical Slice Architecture:
•	Vertical Slice Architecture, also known as Feature Slices or Feature Folders, is an architectural pattern that organizes your codebase around features or user stories.
•	In this approach, each feature or user story has its own set of components, including controllers, views, models, and business logic. These components are organized in a folder or package that represents the feature.
•	The goal is to keep related code together, making it easier to maintain and understand. It often promotes a more modular and maintainable codebase.


Clean Architecture: Each module adheres to Clean Architecture principles, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and maintainability.
2.	Clean Architecture:
•	Clean Architecture is an architectural pattern that focuses on separating concerns and maintaining a clear separation of dependencies within the application.
•	It typically consists of several layers, including the outermost UI layer, an application layer containing business logic, and an innermost layer for data access. These layers depend on each other in a specific direction, enforcing a clear dependency flow.
•	Clean Architecture aims to make the codebase highly testable, independent of frameworks, and easy to change without affecting other parts of the application.
